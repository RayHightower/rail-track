## Setup

After cloning the repository make sure to bundle all dependencies.

```
bundle install
```

Then set up the inital database structure and content.

```
bundle exec rake db:setup
```

Once that's done start up the application.

```
bundle exec rails s
```

The application should be available at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) now.
